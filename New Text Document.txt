Start using CSS by putting <style> in your <head> after your <title>

to change the background color of your website type in body and swiggly brackets {}
make a space between the brackets then type in background-color: 
then either say rgb(000,000,000)or type in a colour name like red,blue,or green
then end with a ;

to change the colour of your text type p,ul,ol,li,any of the headers, ect
then type in color: then rgb or a colour name.
or alternitivly to make all text be one color
type in body: then rgb or colour name
This will make all text that one color

If you only want certain words or paragraphs be one colour you can create ids
to create ids go to the place in your code you want to be unique/ have id
type in id="______" in between the <__> (ex: <h2 id="example">)
the only rules are you can't do spaces or capitals (you could use capitals but is harder to code)
then to add changes to your id
type in your <style> your id with a # in front of it then {} and your change in the brackets.

classes are used to change several things without changing all the things.
like ids you must type in class="_____" in between the <__> (ex: <h2 class="example">)
then in your <style> type in your class name with a . in front of it then {} and your change in the brackets.

to change the font of your text type in p,ul,ol,li, any of the headers, id,class, ect
then type in the {} font-family: then your font.
the font can be any font on your computer from word or powerpoint
if the font is a font from your computer it has to be in lowercase and can have spaces (ex: font-family: comic sans;)
sometimes some other user that have a diffrent computer as you wont be able to see your font because they don't have it downloaded on their computer
so you can use what I like to call universal fonts, these include:
sans-serif, serif, fantasy, monospace, and cursive. These fonts will be seen by everyone


to change font size you need to type in font-size: 000px;in the {}

to make fonts bold without typing in <strong>  you have to use font-weight
type in font-weight: bold; to make several lines of text bold.

to make fonts be in italic (thin and slanted) without typing in <em> you must use

you can change the height your lines of text take up by typing in line-height: 00px
you can also change line height by percent. Just use em instead of px. (ex: 1.5em or 150%)
this will change it acourding the previous size the text was. (ex: 1.5em will increase previous text by 150%)

to align text to a certain area of the page, for example the center, type in text-align: then right or center (left is original and not recommended to do right)

to underline text you can use text-decoration: underline; other text decor include:
overline=text underline is over text. line-through=text crossed out. underline overline=text has lines on top and bottom. blink=text blinks none=text has no decoration
(text-decoration: none; can remove the underline on links.)

to edit certain words in a sentence you can use <span> to do this.
use type in <span>, then create an id, put the words you would liked chnaged in the middle,then end with </span>
(ex: <span class="example">This is an example :)</span>)

to make huge lines of text change you can use <div>
<div> will divide your code into certain section which you change with ids
it is like <span> but with <div> instead
(ex: <div id="longer-example">long ammounts of text with lots of stuff</div>)
